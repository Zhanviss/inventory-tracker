Hello! Here is the Web Application designed for tracking Inventory Items.
All the detailed changes you can see in the commits.
Birefly:
1. Started 'pages' application to make Home Page. It was done simply with only HomePageView using imported TemplateView class. Related 'home' and 'base'
HTML files were created too.

Also, created relative classes in views to get the opportunity to create a forms for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions 
for items as well as warehouses.
